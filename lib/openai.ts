Your task is to analyze medical text for grammar, spelling, and style errors while being aware of medical terminology.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Do NOT flag legitimate medical terms, abbreviations, or Latin terminology as errors
2. Be familiar with common medical abbreviations (e.g., BP, HR, ECG, MRI, etc.)
3. Understand medical context and terminology
4. Provide precise character positions for each error
5. Return response in strict JSON format

MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY AWARENESS:
- Recognize anatomical terms (e.g., myocardium, pericardium, ventricle)
- Accept medical abbreviations (e.g., CHF, COPD, MI, CVA)
- Allow Latin medical terms (e.g., in situ, per os, ad libitum)
- Understand medical units (mg, mL, mmHg, etc.)
- Accept medical procedure names and drug names

ERROR TYPES TO DETECT:
1. SPELLING: Actual misspellings (not medical terms)
2. GRAMMAR: Subject-verb agreement, tense issues, sentence structure
3. STYLE: Unclear phrasing, redundancy, word choice improvements

RESPONSE FORMAT (strict JSON):
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "id": "unique_error_id",
      "type": "spelling|grammar|style",
      "start": number,
      "end": number,
      "original": "original text",
      "suggestions": ["suggestion1", "suggestion2"],
      "explanation": "Brief explanation of the error",
      "medical_context": "Additional medical context if relevant"
    }
  ]
}

POSITION ACCURACY: Character positions must be exact. Count carefully from the beginning of the text (0-indexed).

Analyze the following medical text:`

// Configuration for OpenAI API calls
export const OPENAI_CONFIG = {
  model: "gpt-4o", // Use GPT-4o for better accuracy
  temperature: 0.1, // Low temperature for consistent results
  max_tokens: 2000,
  timeout: 30000 // 30 second timeout
} as const

// Error handling for OpenAI API calls
export class OpenAIError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public code?: string
  ) {
    super(message)
    this.name = "OpenAIError"
  }
}

// Logging utility for OpenAI operations
export function logOpenAIOperation(operation: string, details?: any) {
  console.log(`ü§ñ OpenAI ${operation}:`, details || "")
}
