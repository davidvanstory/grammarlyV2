Your task is to determine if each medical information category is mentioned in the text.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Return only TRUE or FALSE for each category
2. Return response in strict JSON format - NO markdown code blocks, NO backticks, just pure JSON

2. DURATION: Is how long symptoms have been present mentioned?
3. MEDICATION: Are current medications or treatments mentioned?
4. ONSET: Is when/how symptoms started mentioned?
5. INTENSITY: Is symptom severity/intensity mentioned?

SIMPLIFIED RESPONSE FORMAT (strict JSON only):

  "fields": {
    "symptoms": true/false,
    "duration": true/false,
    "medication": true/false,
    "onset": true/false,
    "intensity": true/false
