- [ ] Test topic extraction with various medical research paper samples

### [ ] Topic Classification & Extraction
- [ ] Create system to categorize medical topics (cardiology, neurology, etc.)
- [ ] Implement keyword extraction for specific medical conditions and treatments
- [ ] Add relevance scoring for identified topics
- [ ] Handle edge cases (very short content, non-medical content)
- [ ] Test classification accuracy with known medical texts

---

## Phase 2B: Research Link Generation
**Criteria:** Generate relevant research suggestions based on analyzed content. Depends on Phase 2A completion.


### [ ] General Medical Website Links
- [ ] Curate list of reputable medical websites (Mayo Clinic, WebMD, NIH, PubMed etc.)
- [ ] Create mapping system from topics to relevant website sections
- [ ] Generate topic-specific URLs for major medical resources
- [ ] Implement fallback to general search when specific mapping unavailable
- [ ] Verify all generated links are valid and relevant

### [ ] Link Curation & Ranking
- [ ] Implement scoring system to rank link relevance
- [ ] Create mix of academic sources (PubMed) and educational sources
- [ ] Limit results to top 3-5 most relevant links
- [ ] Add link type categorization (research paper, educational, clinical guidelines)
- [ ] Test link quality and relevance across different medical topics

---

## Phase 2C: Analyze Button & UI Integration  
**Criteria:** User interface for triggering analysis and displaying results. Depends on Phase 2B completion.

### [ ] Analyze Button Implementation
- [ ] Add "Analyze" button to text editor interface
- [ ] Position button prominently but not intrusively in the UI
- [ ] Implement loading state while analysis is processing
- [ ] Add button disabled state when document is too short
- [ ] Style button to match overall application design

### [ ] Analysis Trigger System
- [ ] Connect button click to content analysis API call
- [ ] Add minimum content validation before allowing analysis
- [ ] Implement error handling for failed analysis requests
- [ ] Show appropriate feedback messages during processing
- [ ] Test analysis triggering with various document states

---

## Phase 2D: Results Display System
**Criteria:** Pop-up window to display research links and suggestions. Depends on Phase 2C completion.

### [ ] Pop-up Window Component
- [ ] Create modal/pop-up component for displaying analysis results
- [ ] Implement responsive design for web app
- [ ] Add close button and click-outside-to-close functionality
- [ ] Style pop-up to match application's professional medical theme
- [ ] Test pop-up behavior across different screen sizes

### [ ] Research Links Display
- [ ] Create organized layout for different types of research links
- [ ] Group links by category (academic research, educational resources, clinical)
- [ ] Display link titles, descriptions, and source information. Be brief, professional, and clean in the display. 
- [ ] Implement external link icons and "opens in new tab" behavior
- [ ] Add visual hierarchy to emphasize most relevant results

### [ ] Interactive Link Management
- [ ] Make all research links clickable and functional
- [ ] Ensure links open in new tabs to preserve user's work
- [ ] Add hover effects and visual feedback for link interactions
- [ ] Implement copy-to-clipboard functionality for link URLs
- [ ] Test all links work correctly and lead to relevant content


---

## Phase 2F: Performance & Polish
**Criteria:** Optimization and final refinements for production readiness. Depends on Phase 2E completion.

### [ ] Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize API calls to minimize response time for analysis
- [ ] Implement proper loading states and progress indicators
- [ ] Add request debouncing to prevent duplicate analysis calls
- [ ] Cache frequently analyzed topics for faster subsequent results
- [ ] Test performance with large documents and multiple analyses

### [ ] Quality Assurance & Testing
- [ ] Test analysis accuracy with various medical research topics
- [ ] Verify all generated links are working and relevant
- [ ] Test pop-up functionality across different browsers
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing of complete analysis workflow

### [ ] Integration with Phase 1
- [ ] Ensure analyze feature works seamlessly with existing document management
- [ ] Test interaction between grammar checking and content analysis
- [ ] Verify state management handles both features simultaneously
- [ ] Ensure UI layout accommodates both feature sets appropriately
- [ ] Test complete application workflow from document creation to research analysis

## Implementation Guidelines

### Dependencies Summary
- **Phase 2A → Phase 2B:** Content analysis required for link generation
- **Phase 2B → Phase 2C:** Link generation needed for UI implementation
- **Phase 2C → Phase 2D:** Button functionality required for results display
- **Phase 2D → Phase 2E:** Basic display needed for enhanced features
- **Phase 2E → Phase 2F:** Core functionality required for optimization

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Analysis Accuracy:** AI must correctly identify medical topics for relevant link suggestions
2. **Link Quality:** Generated research links must be genuinely helpful for medical students
3. **User Experience:** Analysis should feel fast and results should be easily accessible
4. **Integration:** Phase 2 features must work seamlessly with existing Phase 1 functionality

### Testing Strategy
- Test with real medical research paper excerpts
- Verify link relevance across different medical specialties
- Test analysis with documents of varying complexity and length
- Ensure pop-up works well on mobile devices
- Validate that all external links are functional and appropriate

### Simplified Scope Notes
- Focus on core functionality rather than advanced features like link saving
- Keep UI simple and intuitive - this is an enhancement, not the main feature
- Prioritize link quality over quantity (3-5 good links better than 10 mediocre ones)
- Remember this is for medical students, so balance academic and educational resources
